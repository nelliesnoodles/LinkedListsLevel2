## Goal

Learn how the nodes are connected by setting thier next and previous links.
Blog links are featured in the nav-bar. 

This replaced the previous version which had hidden links and randomized order to 6 nodes.
For demonstration purposes, I thought maybe this would be a better demo for visual learners.
